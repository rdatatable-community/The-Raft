\[Note: This blog post originally appeared on [albert-rapp.de](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/34_datatable_vs_dplyr/34_datatable_vs_dplyr) and has been shared here to serve both the `{data.table}` and `{dplyr}` communities.\]

In today's blogpost I show you how to do common data cleaning operations via both `{data.table}` and `{dplyr}`. These are two fantastic frameworks inside the R ecosystem. As always, there's also a video version available:

{{< video https://youtu.be/6EWZK2kMano >}}

## Get data

First, let us take a look at our data.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
ames <- modeldata::ames |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  as_tibble() # this is already the case but for comparability done here again
ames
```

We will need to convert it to a `data.table`.

```{r}
df_ames <- as.data.table(ames)
df_ames
```

Also, let us set options for nicer `data.table` outputs. I don't want lot's of columns and rows to flood my console.

```{r}
# Compact printing similar to tibble
options(
    datatable.print.topn = 5,     # Show only top 10 rows
    datatable.print.nrows = 10,   # Limit number of printed rows
    datatable.print.class = TRUE, # Show column classes
    datatable.print.trunc.cols = TRUE # Truncate wide columns
)
```

## The general difference

`{dplyr}` uses functions/verbs that are chained together. This has the advantage that it's easily readable to anybody because the function names are usually understandable even to non-programmers.

On the other hand `{data.table}` uses a super concise code style with lots of abbreviations. This has the advantage that the code is short but if you don't know the system then you might feel lost.

So let me explain the system behind `{data.table}`. The most basic thing to understand is that a data.table `df` can be modified via a bracket using up to three different components. This might look something like `df[i, j, by]`.

The first component `i` refers to rows that are "modified". The second component `j` refers to columns that might be `modified`. And the third component `by` refers to any grouping you might want to use.

But enough theory. Let's see this in action.

## Sort specific columns

::: panel-tabset
### `dplyr`

```{r}
ames |> arrange(lot_frontage) 
```

### `data.table`

```{r}
df_ames[order(lot_frontage)]
```
:::

## Filter for specific rows

::: panel-tabset
### `dplyr`

```{r}
ames |> filter(sale_price > 300000)
```

### `data.table`

```{r}
df_ames[sale_price > 300000]
```
:::

## Select specific columns

::: panel-tabset
### `dplyr`

```{r}
ames |> 
  filter(sale_price > 300000) |> 
  select(neighborhood, sale_price, lot_area)
```

### `data.table`

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(neighborhood, sale_price, lot_area)
]
```

### `data.table` (`.()` shorthand)

If you don't want to type out the `list()` command, you can also use `data.table`'s shorthand notation `.()`.

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  .(neighborhood, sale_price, lot_area)
]
```
:::

## Select many columns by name

::: panel-tabset
### `dplyr`

```{r}
ames |> select(contains('area'))
```

### `data.table`

```{r}
df_ames[, .SD, .SDcols = patterns('area')]
```
:::

## Select many columns by type

::: panel-tabset
### `dplyr`

```{r}
ames |> 
  select(where(is.numeric))
```

### `data.table`

```{r}
df_ames[, .SD, .SDcols = is.numeric]
```
:::

## Compute a new column

::: panel-tabset
### `dplyr`

```{r}
ames |> 
  filter(sale_price > 300000) |> 
  select(neighborhood, sale_price, lot_area) |> 
  mutate(
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area
  )
```

### `data.table` (new data.table)

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(
    neighborhood, 
    sale_price, 
    lot_area,
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area
  )
]
```
:::

## Specialty of `data.table`: modify in place

In the last step we have seen that `mutate()` and using a `list()` inside the `[]` of a `data.table` work almost similarly. But there's a specialty that you might want to keep in mind.

You see, in the previous example we created a new `data.table`. And that's why we have seen an output after `df_ames[...]`. But checkout what happens if I don't use `list()` and instead use the `:=` operator inside the brackets.

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  price_by_lot_area := sale_price / lot_area
]
```

See? No output. But if we look at `df_ames`, we'll notice that the `price_by_lot_area` was actually created. And that happened even though we never overwrote `df_ames` like `df_ames <-`.

```{r}
# Notice no filter on rows here as first argument was left blank.
df_ames[, price_by_lot_area] |> head(30)
```

Notice now that we have lots of `NA`s in that column now. This happens because we instructed R to only compute the `price_by_lot_area` column where `sale_price > 300000`. Interesting how that works, isn't it?

If you wanted to calculate all values, you could leave out the filtering condition.

```{r}
df_ames[, price_by_lot_area := sale_price / lot_area]
df_ames[, price_by_lot_area] |> head(30)
```

## Calculate multiple new columns

::: panel-tabset
### `dplyr`

```{r}
ames |> 
  filter(sale_price > 300000) |> 
  select(neighborhood, sale_price, lot_area) |> 
  mutate(
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price),
    log_price_by_lot_area = log_sale_price / lot_area
  )
```

### `data.table` (new)

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(
    neighborhood, 
    sale_price, 
    lot_area,
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price),
    log_price_by_lot_area = log(sale_price) / lot_area
  )
]
```

### `data.table` (in-place)

To create multiple columns in place, you can either use the `let()` command

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  let(
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price),
    log_price_by_lot_area = log(sale_price) / lot_area
  )
]
```

or the `:=` operator.

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  `:=`(
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price),
    log_price_by_lot_area = log(sale_price) / lot_area
  )
]
```
:::

## Specialty of `data.table`: chaining

Notice that in both previous `data.table` examples we have used `log(sale_price)` twice. That means after calculating the `log_sale_price` column, we didn't actually use that column later on. The reason for this is that it simply doesn't work. You cannot calculate a new column and use it in the same step.

```{r}
#| error: true
# reset df_ames so that `log_sale_price` doesn't exist
# due to previous calculations.
df_ames <- as.data.table(ames) 
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(
    neighborhood, 
    sale_price, 
    lot_area,
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price),
    log_price_by_lot_area = log_sale_price / lot_area # log_sale_price here
  )
]
```

One way to fix that is to use chain operations. You can do so by using multiple brackets like `df_ames[...][...]`, you can chain multiple operations.

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(
    neighborhood, 
    sale_price, 
    lot_area,
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price)
  )
][, log_price_by_lot_area := log_sale_price / lot_area]
```

Notice that this technically worked and didn't throw an error, but you cannot find any of the new columns in `df_ames`.

```{r}
#| error: true
df_ames[, list(neighborhood, log_price_by_lot_area)]
df_ames[, list(neighborhood, log_sale_price)]
```

Here's why that happened: First, we created **a new** data.table by not using the in-place version. Remember how the `list()` command creates a new `data.table`? That's why you get an output here:

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(
    neighborhood, 
    sale_price, 
    lot_area,
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price)
  )
]
```

But if you don't save this into a new variable, then this new data table isn't saved. Now, in the next step, we use the in-place mode of operations on the **new** data.table.

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(
    neighborhood, 
    sale_price, 
    lot_area,
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price)
  )
][, log_price_by_lot_area := log_sale_price / lot_area]
```

This technically works but in-place calculations don't return anything. They just modify the existing object. But the existing object is the **new** data.table that we still never saved anywhere. Hence, that calculation runs successfully but the results vanish the moment the calculation finishes.

What's worse is that even if you try to save these results later, it's no use. See? No results here:

```{r}
df_test <- df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(
    neighborhood, 
    sale_price, 
    lot_area,
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price)
  )
][, log_price_by_lot_area := log_sale_price / lot_area]
df_test
```

So there are two ways you could fix this. Either chain your results without using the in-place calculations. This means either using `list()` or `.()` in later steps of the chain.

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(
    neighborhood, 
    sale_price, 
    lot_area,
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price)
  )
][, .(log_price_by_lot_area = log_sale_price / lot_area)]
```

As we've seen before, this will then only return a `data.table` with the filtered rows. Or alternatively, you could use only in-place calculation.

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  let(
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price)
  )
][, log_price_by_lot_area := log_sale_price / lot_area]

df_ames[
  # Set filter to see both NA and non-NA values
  sale_price > 200000, 
  .(neighborhood, price_by_lot_area, log_sale_price, log_price_by_lot_area)
]
```

But personally I prefer to chain things with a pipe operator. With the R native pipe operator `|>` and its placeholder variable `_` this works pretty well.

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(
    neighborhood, 
    sale_price, 
    lot_area,
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price)
  )
] |> 
  _[, .(log_price_by_lot_area = log_sale_price / lot_area)]
```

## Calculate summary statistics (without grouping)

::: panel-tabset
### `dplyr`

```{r}
ames |> 
  filter(sale_price > 300000) |> 
  select(neighborhood, sale_price, lot_area) |> 
  mutate(
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price),
    log_price_by_lot_area = log_sale_price / lot_area
  ) |> 
  summarize(
    mean_sale_price = mean(sale_price),
    n_houses = n()
  )
```

### `data.table`

In `data.tables` the special variable `.N` refers to the amount of rows. In this case `.N` refers to the amount of all rows. In a grouped setting, `.N` would refer to the group sizes.

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(
    mean_sale_price = mean(sale_price),
    n_houses = .N
  )
]
```
:::

## Calculate summary statistics (with grouping)

::: panel-tabset
### `dplyr`

```{r}
ames |> 
  filter(sale_price > 300000) |> 
  select(neighborhood, sale_price, lot_area) |> 
  mutate(
    price_by_lot_area = sale_price / lot_area,
    log_sale_price = log(sale_price),
    log_price_by_lot_area = log_sale_price / lot_area
  ) |> 
  summarize(
    mean_sale_price = mean(sale_price),
    n_houses = n(),
    .by = neighborhood # use grouping
  )
```

### `data.table`

In `data.tables` the special variable `.N` refers to the amount of rows. In this case `.N` refers to the amount of all rows. In a grouped setting, `.N` would refer to the group sizes.

```{r}
df_ames[
  sale_price > 300000, 
  list(
    mean_sale_price = mean(sale_price),
    n_houses = .N
  ),
  by = neighborhood  # use grouping
]
```

## Iterate over multiple columns

Let's combine our knowledge of selecting multiple columns to calculate summary stats for many columns.

::: panel-tabset
### `dplyr`

In `dplyr` this needs the `across()` function inside of `summarize()`.

```{r}
ames |> 
  summarize(
    across(
      .cols = contains('area'),
      .fns = mean
    ),
    .by = neighborhood
  )
```

### `data.table`

In `data.table`, you can just use the `.SD` variable again and combine that with `lapply()`.

```{r}
df_ames[, 
  c(
    lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_houses = .N
  ),
  by = neighborhood,
  .SDcols = patterns('area')
]
```
:::

Notice that for `data.table` we had to use the `c()` function to comine results. Had we used a list via `.()`, then results wouldn't look quite the same.

```{r}
df_ames[, 
  .(
    lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_houses = .N
  ),
  by = neighborhood,
  .SDcols = patterns('area')
]
```

Or we could also cover, say, numeric columns. In that case we shouldn't use `.cols = contains()` and `.SDcols = patterns()`. Instead we'd use `.cols = where(is.numeric)` and `.SDcols = is.numeric`:

::: panel-tabset
### `dplyr`

```{r}
ames |> 
  summarize(
    across(
      .cols = where(is.numeric),
      .fns = mean
    ),
    .by = neighborhood
  )
```

### `data.table`

In `data.tables` the special variable `.N` refers to the amount of rows. In this case `.N` refers to the amount of all rows. In a grouped setting, `.N` would refer to the group sizes.

```{r}
df_ames[, 
  c(
    lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_houses = .N
  ),
  by = neighborhood,
  .SDcols = is.numeric
]
```

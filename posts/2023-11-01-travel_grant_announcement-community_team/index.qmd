We on the community team are very excited to announce another major funding opportunity!

![Sea lions rejoice!](https://media.tenor.com/Ce9c6P-Ztc0AAAAd/smile-delighted.gif){width="40%" fig-align="center"}

As [you may know,](https://rdatatable-community.github.io/The-Raft/posts/2023-10-15-intro_to_grant-toby_hocking/) the National Science Foundation (NSF) has provided funds to support the project "Expanding the data.table ecosystem for efficient big data manipulation in R." One goal of this project is to better disseminate information about the development and progress of the `data.table` package.

To this end, [applications are now open](https://forms.gle/7Nb7E5GweiYdi93o7) for the **data.table Ambassadors Grant** to fund conference travel for presentations related to `data.table`.

## Ambassadors

In order to become a funded ambassador, applicants must meet the following requirements:

1.  Present a talk, poster, or tutorial at a relevant conference or meeting that is in some way related to the `data.table` package.

2.  Write a blog post about the talk/presentation for *The Raft*.

Funding is in the form of a flat **\$2700 stipend** towards travel and registration expenses, to be paid upon completion of the presentation and blog post.

This program will fund up to 4 Ambassadors per year for the next three years. We are particularly interested in facilitating travel for applicants who may not have as much opportunity; such as early-career researchers, or those from historically marginalized communities.

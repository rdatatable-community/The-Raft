This blog is dedicated to building the community around the `data.table` R package. Its startup is funded by NSF-POSE Grant called "**Expanding the data.table ecosystem for efficient big data manipulation in R".** Here you will find announcements related to the grant, as well as tips, updates, and tutorials for `data.table` and its sister packages.

The `data.table` project is fiscally sponsored by [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/). Consider making 
a [tax-deductible donation](https://numfocus.org/donate-to-data-table) to help the project 
pay for developer time, professional services, travel, workshops, and a variety of other needs.

*NumFOCUS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity in the United States; as such, donations to
NumFOCUS are tax-deductible as allowed by law. As with any donation, you should
consult with your personal tax adviser or the IRS about your particular tax situation.*
